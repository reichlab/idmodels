# idmodels

A Python module for modeling infectious disease.  Currently supports two classes of models:

 - gradient boosting quantile regression (`gbqr`)
 - seasonal autoregressive integrated models with exogenous covariates (`sarix`)

## Installing and running the package (no development)

To install this package via pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/reichlab/idmodels.git
```

## Setup for local development

The steps below are for setting up a local development environment. This process entails more than just installing the package,
because we need to ensure that all developers have a consistent, reproducible environment.

### Assumptions

Developers will be using a Python virtual environment that:

- is based on the Python version specified in [.python-version](.python-version).
- contains the dependency versions specified in the "lockfile" (in this case [requirements/requirements-dev.txt](requirements/requirements-dev.txt)).
- contains the package installed in ["editable" mode](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#working-in-development-mode).

### Setup steps

1. Clone this repository

2. Change to the repo's root directory:

    ```bash
    cd idmodels
    ```

3. Make sure the correct version of Python is currently active, and create a Python virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    # MacOs/Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # Windows
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

5. Install the package dependencies and install the package in editable mode:

    ```bash
    python -m pip install -r requirements/requirements-dev.txt && python -m pip install -e .
    ```

6. **Optional:** if you use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) in your workflow to automate code formatting and other tasks, [install it](https://pre-commit.com/#install). Otherwise, delete [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](.pre-commit-config.yaml).

7. Run the test suite to confirm that everything is working:

    ```bash
    python -m pytest
    ```

## Development workflow

Because the package is installed in "editable" mode, you can run the code as though it were a normal Python package, while also
being able to make changes and see them immediately.

### Updating dependencies

Prerequisites:
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started)

**Note:** using [`pipx`](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) (instead of pip) to install `uv` is a handy way to ensure that uv is available for all of the Python environments on your machine.

The "lockfile" for this project is simply an annotated requirements.txt that is generated by [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (uv is a replacement for [pip-compile](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/), which
could also be used). There's also a requirements-dev.txt file that contains dependencies needed for development (_e.g._, pytest).

To add or remove a project dependency:

1. Add or remove the dependency in the `[dependencies]` section of `pyproject.toml` (or in the `dev` section of `[project.optional-dependencies]`, if it's a development dependency). Don't pin a specific version, since that will make it harder for users to install the package.

2. Generate updated requirements files:

    ```bash
    uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements/requirements.txt && uv pip compile pyproject.toml --extra dev -o requirements/requirements-dev.txt
    ```

3. Update project dependencies:

    **Note:** This package was originally developed on MacOS. If you have trouble installing the dependencies. `uv pip sync` has a [`--python-platform` flag](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#multi-platform-resolution) that can be used to specify the platform.

    ```bash
    # note: requirements-dev.txt contains the base requirements AND the dev requirements
    #
    # using pip
    python -m pip install -r requirements/requirements-dev.txt
    #
    # alternately, you can use uv to install the dependencies: it is faster and has a
    # a handy sync option that will cleanup unused dependencies
    uv pip sync requirements/requirements-dev.txt && python -m pip install -e .
    ```
