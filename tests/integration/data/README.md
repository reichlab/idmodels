The two files in this directory's subdirectories are outputs from the GBQR and SARIX models, respectively. They were generated by saving the `actual_df` outputs from their corresponding test files (test_gbqr.py and test_sarix.py) and configurations. `test_gbqr.py` and `test_sarix.py` run the models again with the same configurations and test for equivalence to ensure reproducibility.
